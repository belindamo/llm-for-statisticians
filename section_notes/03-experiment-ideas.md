## Overview

Our experimental approach focuses on validating the theoretical framework that transformers with carefully designed prompts can approximate smooth functions with configurable precision. We test core assumptions identified in the literature review about discrete token limitations, sequential reasoning constraints, and static prompt effectiveness.

**Research Hypothesis**: Transformers can be configured through prompts to act as function approximators, with soft/continuous prompting approaches providing superior precision and adaptability compared to traditional discrete methods.

**Core Assumptions to Test**:
1. Prompts can reconfigure transformer internal computations for function approximation
2. Continuous/soft prompts outperform discrete tokens for smooth function tasks  
3. Dynamic prompt adaptation improves approximation quality over static approaches
4. Theoretical approximation bounds hold in practical implementations
